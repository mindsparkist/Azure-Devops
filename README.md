In Azure DevOps, "Organization," "Project," and "Team" are key structural elements that help you manage your software development lifecycle. Here's a breakdown of each and how they relate:

**1. Organization**

*   **The highest level:** Think of an organization as a container for all your projects. It represents your company or a division within your company.
*   **Administrative boundary:** It provides a boundary for administration, security, and billing.
*   **URL:** Your organization gets a unique URL (e.g., `dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}`).

**2. Project**

*   **A container for your work:** A project holds all the artifacts needed to build and deliver a specific software product or service.
*   **Includes:** Repositories (for source code), boards (for work tracking), pipelines (for CI/CD), test plans, and more.
*   **Within an organization:** You can have multiple projects within a single organization.
*   **Formerly "Team Project":** In older versions of Azure DevOps, projects were called "Team Projects."

**3. Team**

*   **A subset of project members:** Teams are used to organize people within a project.
*   **Focus and autonomy:** They allow groups to focus on specific areas of a project, with their own backlogs, boards, and dashboards.
*   **Multiple teams per project:** A project can have one or more teams.
*   **Hierarchy:** Teams can be organized in hierarchies (teams and sub-teams) to reflect organizational structure.

**How they relate**

*   **Organization > Project > Team:** This is the hierarchy. An organization contains projects, and projects contain teams.
*   **Work isolation and collaboration:** Projects provide a level of isolation for different software initiatives, while teams allow for focused work and collaboration within those initiatives.
*   **Example:** Imagine a company ("Organization") developing two products: a mobile app and a web service. Each product would be a separate "Project." Within the "Mobile App" project, you might have teams for "iOS Development," "Android Development," and "Testing."

**Key takeaways**

*   Use organizations to represent your company or major divisions.
*   Use projects to represent individual software products or services.
*   Use teams to organize people within a project and give them autonomy over their work.

By understanding this structure, you can effectively organize your work in Azure DevOps and ensure that your teams can collaborate efficiently.
